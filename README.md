# RoboWars Bot: IronDrum
## Overview

IronDrum is a lightweight combat robot designed for RoboWars competitions. The bot features an aluminum frame, a robust sheet aluminum body, a cast iron rotating drum weapon powered by a BLDC motor, and wireless control via an ESP32 microcontroller paired with an NRF24L01 module.

The focus of the bot's design is durability, mobility, and destructive power through its spinning drum weapon.
Features
1. Chassis and Body

    Frame: Constructed from lightweight and durable aluminum for structural stability.
    Body: Encased in sheet aluminum, offering protection to internal components while keeping the bot lightweight.

2. Weapon System

    Weapon: Cast iron rotating drum designed for high kinetic energy impacts.
    Motor: Powered by a high-torque BLDC motor, ensuring rapid acceleration and sustained spin speed during combat.

3. Electronics

    Microcontroller: ESP32, offering robust processing power and versatility for control logic.
    Communication Module: NRF24L01 for low-latency, wireless control.

4. Mobility

    Driven by DC motors (not detailed but assumed as part of the bot's mobility system), the bot is highly maneuverable in the arena.
